# Directory introduction
This directory contains some of the files used in the single cell example.

barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv, matrix.mtx: The single-cell transcriptomic data used in this study was derived from PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell) samples and can be obtained from the following source: https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz.

# Data link
```{r echo=FALSE}

    recurse = TRUE, regexp = "[.]html$", invert = TRUE)[, 1:3] |>
    as.data.frame() |> subset()
x_link <- gsub(x$path,
  pattern = "examples/single_cell/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/",
  replacement = ""
)
x$path <- sprintf("[%s](%s)", x$path, x_link)
